		<h2>My Journey as a Librarian</h2>

    		<p>
	        I was born in Afghanistan in 1982, but due to the war with the Soviet Union, my family sought refuge in Iran when I was just two years old. 
	        I completed my education in Tehran and later pursued a degree in Information Science and Librarianship at 
 	       Al-Zahra University, graduating in 2008.
